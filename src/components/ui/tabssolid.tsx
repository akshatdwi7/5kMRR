          You have 60 days from the time we've shipped your order to return any
          part of it to us for a refund, provided it is still in its original,
          unused condition: we do not accept returns of used items.
        </p>
        <p>
          No return authorization (RMA) is required. If you are within the
          United States, a pre-paid shipping label will be generated. For direct
          returns, a flat fee of $10 is deducted from your return for shipping
          and processing costs.

          We ship worldwide via UPS Expedited. We offer flat rate shipping to
          customers in Canada ($30), the EU, Japan, and Singapore ($45â€“$65+),
          and Australia ($65). Note that most brokerage fees are included in the
          price of UPS Expedited shipping, with the exception of a possible $10
          fee assessed in Canada only if prior arrangements to pay for duties
          and taxes are not made (see next question and answer).
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of the United States, tariffs, duties, and taxes are the
          responsibility of the customer and are usually paid at time of
          delivery.
